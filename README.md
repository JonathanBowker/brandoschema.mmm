**Brando Schema: Machine-Readable Brand Identity Structures for AI and LLMs**

The Brando<sup>®</sup> repository contains specifications for the Brando Brand Definition Vocabulary (BDV), a schema.org extension providing modular, machine-readable constructs to model brand identity facets—verbal, visual, audio, positioning, governance, and assets—designed to enable consistent, compliant, and expressive brand representation in AI systems and LLM-enabled environments.

## Mission

The mission of the Brando Schema is to empower brands to express their identity in a structured, declarative format optimized for AI and Large Language Models (LLMs). By extending [`schema:Brand`](https://schema.org/Brand), Brando enables brands to encode tone, visual style, audio branding, strategic positioning, governance policies, and reusable assets in ways that AI systems can interpret, enforce, and retrieve with precision.

This framework supports brand strategists, AI developers, compliance officers, and semantic web architects in future-proofing brand identity for increasingly AI-driven digital ecosystems.

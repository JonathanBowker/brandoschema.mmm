**Brando<sup>®</sup>** is a Schema.org extension toolkit designed to transform static brand guidelines and policies into structured, machine-readable data. It enables brands to express how they are interpreted, represented, and governed within AI systems.

At the core of Brando is the `brando:BrandObject`, a comprehensive schema type that encapsulates a brand’s **Verbal Identity** and **Visual Identity** with behavioural guardrails, tone, and usage policies. It turns traditional brand guidelines into application control policies for intelligent agents.

These AI facing policy datasets are published in a publicly accessible location:

``` text
/.well-known/ai-control-policy.json
```

... formatted using **JSON-LD**, and aligned with Schema.org principles. This JSON file serves as the authoritative contract between a brand and AI systems to enforce schema compliance on model outputs. 

## Background and Motivation

As AI systems, language models, and intelligent agents have become dominant interfaces for discovery, conversation, and decision-making, brands can no longer rely solely on static style guides, visual assets, or even traditional SEO techniques. While search engine optimisation remains important, it must now be complemented by AI optimisation using structured, AI-readable metadata that enables consistent brand behaviour and governance across intelligent systems. 

The rapid development of the AI-web is creating a critcal need for Brands to evolve into **AI-native entities** — capable of interacting, reasoning, responding, and adapting across platforms, agents, and voice-based systems. Without structured, machine-readable definitions of tone, values, usage policies, and interaction guardrails, brands risk being misrepresented, diluted, or ignored entirely in AI-mediated spaces.

**Brando<sup>®</sup> was created to solve this challenge** — enabling brands to participate fully, safely, and consistently in the fast-changing AI ecosystem. It bridges the gap between human-authored brand guidelines and machine-executable identity by defining a structured schema for verbal, visual, and behavioural brand governance.

## Why Brando<sup>®</sup> Exists

Brando<sup>®</sup> transforms static brand concepts into dynamic, machine-actionable assets, enabling a future where **Brand <-> AI <-> User**
interactions are:

- Optimised
- Governed
- Compliant
- On-brand by design
- On-brand by default

Brando<sup>®</sup> **breathes life into static brands**, allowing them to be experienced as:

- Intelligent agents
- AI-aware APIs
- Governed conversational entities
- Controlled outputs within large language models

## Summary Statement

> **Brando<sup>®</sup> is the first schema framework that enables brands to express who they are, what they believe, and how they should behave — in a way machines can understand, enforce and operate.**

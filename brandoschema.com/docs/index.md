## Building AI controls using Brand Definition Vocabulary (BDV)

**Brando** is a Schema.org-compatible extension that transforms brand guidelines and policies into structured, machine-readable schemas — enabling your brand to be consistently recognised, represented, and governed across AI systems.

At the heart of the Brando Schema is `brando:BrandObject`, a powerful type that encodes:

- **Verbal Identity**  
- **Visual Identity** 
- **Audio Identity** 
- **Brand Positioning** 
- **Brand Governance**  
- **Brand Assets**

Brando uses [Brand Definition Vocabulary (BDV)](https://brandoschema.com/bdv-classes) to turn static brand guidelines into machine-executable controls for intelligent agents.

This AI-facing brand policy is published in a public, discoverable format:  
 
```
/.well-known/ai-brand-policy.json
```  
  
Structured using **JSON-LD** and aligned to Schema.org principles, this file serves as the authoritative interface between your brand and AI systems — guiding how models interpret, generate, and respond.

## Why Brands Need Brando

As AI-powered systems and large language models (LLMs) are becoming the dominant channels for customer interaction and content gatekeeping, **brands face new risks**:

- Being misrepresented in LLM answers  
- Losing tone, intent, or uniqueness in AI-generated content  
- Failing compliance, ethical, or reputational checks in automated outputs  
- Becoming invisible in semantic and conversational search

Search Engine Optimisation (SEO) is no longer enough. Brands need **AI Optimisation** — machine-readable operating policies that govern brand representation at inference time.


## The Case for AI-Native Brand Governance

The rise of the **AI web** demands that brands become **AI-native entities** — able to interact, reason, and respond reliably across platforms, plugins, and voice agents.

> Without clear policies guiding how a brand should — and should *not* — speak, appear, and behave, it risks losing visibility, control, and trust in AI-driven environments.

**Brando solves this** — creating a semantic bridge between your brand guidelines and the systems interpreting them.

## What Brando Does

Brando transforms brand assets into machine-actionable controls, enabling:

- Brand-accurate LLM responses  
- AI-safe usage of visual assets and tone  
- Structured metadata for search and plugins  
- Governed agent interactions  
- Fully compliant and ethically-aware outputs

Your brand becomes:

- **Discoverable** by intelligent agents  
- **Interpretable** by LLMs and APIs  
- **Governable** in real-time across outputs  
- **Consistent** across AI use cases


## Brando as Operating Infrastructure

Brando makes your brand:

- **Machine-readable**
- **AI-visible**
- **Compliance-aware**
- **On-brand by default**

> **Brando is the first schema framework that enables brands to express who they are, what they believe, and how they should behave — in a format machines can enforce.**

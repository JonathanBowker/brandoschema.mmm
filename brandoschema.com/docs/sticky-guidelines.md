# Sticky Guidelines

Sticky Guidelines are machine-readable, brand-aligned instructions that travel with your metadata across the AI Web. They guide how intelligent systems describe, present, and interpret your brand identity — across assistants, language models, semantic search, and RAG pipelines.

Sticky Guidelines are implemented using the Brando BDL vocabulary — a Schema.org-compatible extension of [`schema:Brand`](https://schema.org/Brand`) — and provide clear boundaries and expectations for AI systems interacting with your brand.

## Why Sticky Guidelines Matter

Without structured guidelines, AI systems can easily misrepresent your brand:

- Hallucinate brand claims, product offerings, or roles  
- Associate your brand with irrelevant or undesirable topics  
- Omit mandatory disclaimers or attribution rules  
- Erode tone of voice, trust signals, or positioning  
- Trigger regulatory concerns (e.g., GDPR, ASA, ICO)

Sticky Guidelines reduce these risks by expressing brand expectations, exclusions, legal signals, and internal policy alignment — all in a machine-readable format.

## Relationship to Schema.org

Sticky Guidelines extend [`schema:Brand`](https://schema.org/Brand). While Schema.org covers identity fields like `name`, `url`, and `logo`, Brando BDL introduces AI-aware fields such as:

- `bdl:llmDoNotSay`  
- `bdl:representationConstraints`  
- `bdl:dataProtectionStatement`  
- `bdl:requiresInternalApproval`  

These are defined within a JSON-LD context:

```json
"@context": {
  "@vocab": "https://schema.org/",
  "bdl": "https://brandoschema.com/bdl#"
}
```

This ensures compatibility with semantic crawlers, LLM indexing, schema validators, and search engines.

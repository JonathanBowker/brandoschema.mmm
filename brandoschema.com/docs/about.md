# About Brando<sup>®</sup>

**Brando** is a semantic framework for expressing and protecting brand identity in the AI age.

At its core is the **Brand Definition Vocabulary (BDV)** — a machine-readable vocabulary that extends [schema.org/Brand](https://schema.org/Brand), enabling organisations to define their brand’s verbal identity, visual system, positioning, and AI safety rules using structured formats such as JSON-LD.

## Why Brando?

**Traditional brand guidelines were designed for humans — not machines**. PDFs, style guides, and visual identity decks don’t translate to AI assistants, LLMs, or semantic search crawlers.

Without structured metadata, brands risk:
- Inconsistent tone and messaging
- Misleading or non-compliant AI responses
- Reduced visibility in AI-powered search and assistants
- Loss of brand integrity in generative and conversational content

Brando solves this by introducing **AI-native, portable brand definitions** that intelligent systems can interpret, apply, and enforce in real time.

## Brand Safety in the AI-Driven Web

Modern AI systems increasingly speak on behalf of brands — summarising, recommending, answering, or generating on their behalf — without direct human intervention.

### Risks of Unstructured AI Interaction

- **Inconsistent messaging** and contradictory outputs
- **Reputational harm** from off-brand or unethical responses
- **Misrepresentation of brand values**, ethics, or tone
- **Compliance violations** in regulated industries
- **Loss of uniqueness** as brand voices blur into generic AI output
- **Content leakage** or **unintended brand associations**
- **Fragmented brand narratives** across platforms and assistants

## Why Structured AI Brand Guidelines Matter

Brando enables organisations to define enforceable brand guidelines in a format that intelligent systems can understand and follow:

- **Centralised brand identity metadata**
- **Declarative risk and content exclusions**
- **Consistent representation across AI platforms**
- **Controlled use of logos, colours, typefaces**
- **Alignment with business strategy and AI policy**
- **Ethical and safety-aware AI deployment**

## UK Compliance Context

Brando helps UK-based brands meet the growing demand for transparency and accountability in AI systems by aligning brand governance with key frameworks:

- **GDPR** and data handling standards (ICO)
- **Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)** guidance
- **Digital Markets, Competition & Consumer Bill** expectations for fairness and transparency

Through structured declarations, Brando embeds compliance and safety principles into the fabric of how brands operate in AI environments.

## What Is the BDL Vocabulary?

The Brand Definition Language supports:

- **Verbal identity**: tone, voice, and mission
- **Visual identity**: logos, colours, layout, and media
- **Safety controls**: restricted topics, refusal strategies, ethical guardrails
- **Compliance metadata**: GDPR, licensing, attribution, and traceability
- **AI-specific features**: assistant-safe prompts, RAG relevance scoring, and generative risk controls

See the [Vocabulary Reference](vocabulary.md) for a complete list of Brando Schema terms — including `brando:hasVerbalIdentity`, `brando:hasVisualIdentity`, `brando:hasPositioning`, and `brando:hasGovernance`.
